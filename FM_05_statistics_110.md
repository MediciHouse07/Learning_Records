### Questions: <br>
PDF PMS CDF, always forgot the difference between them
### Lecture 1 <br>
2022/02/20: finished
### Lecture 2 <br>
2022/02/23: finished
### Lecture 3 <br>
2022/02/24: 1219/4854 birthday problem<br>
2022/03/24: finished, the last problem is hard, I might need to listen the question again, and has something to do with taylor series, 1-1/e
### Lecture 4 <br>
2022/03/26: finished, the begining of this lecture has a continue relation with the end of Lecture 3 <br>

### Lecture 5 <br>
2022/03/30: 1907/5001 law of total probability, conditionging<br>
2022/03/31: finished, conditioning independent doesn't imply unconditioning independent and vice versa
### Lecture 6 <br>

### Lecture 7
2022/03/29: ðŸ’« 2618/5145 , it has someting to do with Lecture 5, law of total probability <br>
2022/03/30: 2618 around, just to review basing on the law of total probility, see what is the new understanding <br>
2022/03/31: finished, excellent course, random variable, is a function which maps result happened in sample space S to X(s), then you got a distribution, the distribution indicates the variness/randomness of the variable, PMF is just like, P(X=3) if you through a coin, probability of number of heads equals to 3 <br>
### Lecture 8
2022/03/31: 2111/5023 around 14 minutes CDF and PMF, both are a way of describing distribution, CDF P(X<=x), PMF P(X=aj) only applies for discrete problem <br>
2022/03/31: finished, around 2857 minutes by independence, knowing A gives no information about B, vandermonte sigma j=0 to k(m choose k-j times n choose k)=m plus n choose k, 10/100000 will make the difference between with replacement and without replacement sort of the same
### Lecture 9 <br>
2022/03/14: ðŸ’« finished, in order to understand so called taylor Expectation in link [Financial math expectation problems](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/finance_math.md#lecture-3-) <br>
2022/03/31: finished, 2635 minutes Expectation and P has a bridge; 3248 minutes linearity, EX+Y=EX+EY no matter it is dependent or independent; bridge X={1 if A, 0 otherwise, this is indicator R.V. ; 4158 check PMF, geo distribution; 3827 by symatry and bridge
### Lecture 10 <br>
2022/03/14: ðŸ’« 0610/5010 in order to understand so called taylor Expectation in link [Financial math expectation problems](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/finance_math.md#lecture-3-) <br>
2022/03/31: 2230/5010, 1026 minutes, add 2 functions = compute 2 function and add the result; ends at negative nomial distribution <br>
2022/04/01: finished, round 29 minutes negative binomial distribution, first success distribution; 39 minutes, indication + linearity + symetry, and pubble world
### Lecture 11 <br>
2022/04/01: finished, around 21 minutes, by linearity, binomial converge to poisson, e^x = 1 + e/1 + e^2/2 + ... e^n/n! ; need to check calculus, rate of change, law of lopital
### Lecture 12 <br>
2022/04/02: finished, around 1616 minutes FTC from calculus; 3803 minutes, take a function of R.V. is a R.V. ; law of the unconsicious stastician, LOTUS E(g(x))=accumulate from -infinite to +infinite g(x)fX(x)dx; uniform can be everything, just like a indicator I, 4907 minutes, P(F-1(u)<=x)=P(u<=F(x)) because CDF is continously increasing 
### Lecture 17 <br>
2022/03/14: ðŸ’« MGF [Financial math expectation problems](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/finance_math.md#lecture-3-) <br>
### Lecture 18 <br>
2022/03/14: ðŸ’« MGF [Financial math expectation problems](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/finance_math.md#lecture-3-) <br>
### Lecture 25 <br>
2022/03/29: ðŸ’« 432/4814, suddenly want to back to basic stuffs <br>
### Lecture 28 <br>
2022/03/14: ðŸ’« Che inequality [Financial math expectation problems](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/finance_math.md#lecture-3-) <br>
### Lecture 29 <br>
2022/03/14: ðŸ’« Che inequality [Financial math expectation problems](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/finance_math.md#lecture-3-) <br>
