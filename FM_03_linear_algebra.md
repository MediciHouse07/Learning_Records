2022/03/24: ðŸ’« finished why when m>n, which means by which m equations and n unknown there is no solution?

### Lecture 15 <br>
2022/03/25:  finished why when m>n, which means by which m equations and n unknown there is no solution? because: it might have a situation like 0=1, or x1=1 in the same time x1=2

### Lecture 16 <br>
2022/03/27: finished, it is worth of a review, if A has independent column, ATA must be invertible
### Lecture 17 <br>
2022/03/28: finished, A=QR, a projection R is right upper triangle matrix, R links A and Q, Q is a orthonormal matrix; vector in the column space of A, projection of A is I
### Lecture 18 <br>

### Lecture 20
2022/03/30: finished, area of triangle, area of parallel 4 sides, cramer rules x=detB/detA, where B = b|Rest of A

### Lecture 21
2022/03/30: finished, shortage of eigen vector; asymatric matrix leads to complex eigen value
### Lecture 22
2022/03/31: finished, the application of eigen value and eigen vector, difference equation, eigen value can describe how fast a series like fabonacci series evolves
### Lectuer 23
2022/03/31: 1653/5103, why resolve a differential equation has something to do with e^lambda t?
