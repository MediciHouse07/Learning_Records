- the set of accumulation point
- NA = empty
- but N contain all of its accumulation points
- it is a closed set
- boundness and closeness are logically independent
- closed and bounded makes a set compact
- existence of global minimum and global maximum

- accumulation point is limit point
- for all r>0
- you can't isolate accumulation point
