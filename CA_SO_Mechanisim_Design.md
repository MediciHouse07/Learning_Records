# (AGT11E10) [Game Theory] Single Peaked Preferences

0000<->End

2025/01/22

- nice property is not dictatorial
- single peak for agent 1
- irrelevant
- line up preferences
- reach to peak utility going up, away from peak utility going down, line up preference in the same way for different agent
- preference domain

# (AGT11E9) [Game Theory] Gibbard - Satterthwaite Impossibility Theorem Revisited

2025/01/21

0000<->0700 End

- voting GS Theorem
- ordinal preference, cardinal preference
- strict order over D
- D is decision, is whom to vote to
- voter i who is dictator

# (AGT11E10) [Game Theory]

2025/01/21

0000<->0300

- 159.3 159.0
- single peaked preferences, add some restriction to make the impossible possible
- type space is strict ranking over D
- D is which to choose in the end
- theta is type profile, instead of the order itself

# (AGT11E8) [Game Theory] Direct Mechanisms, Dominant Strategy IC, and Revelation Principle

2025/01/20

0000<->1000

- social choice function is a direct mechanism
- DSIC
- dominant strategy to tell truth regardless of what their true type is
- theta i is a dominant strategy at theta i, means telling the truth
- A SCF is strategy proof iff f is DSIC
- if it doesn't exist direct mechanism which is strategy proof , then there is no m,g implement f
- revealation principle for D.S.

# (AGT11E6) [Game Theory] Mechanisms

2025/01/19

- g procduce an output or decision, which is which plant to be built given different input m(theta)
- social choice function is a mechanism
- M,g
- M stands for message space
- g is an outcome function
- g choose a social choice function
- g output D and Rn, which are the things needed for social choice function
- message in auction, the bet
- D in auction, choose winner
- Rn pays how much
- number of message may be different or more than preference, private theta

# (AGT11E7) [Game Theory] Dominant Strategy Mechanism Design

2025/01/19

- mechanism induce a game
- mi is a dominant strategy condition on theta i
- NE is not a strict dominant strategy
- g implement f in NE
- indirect mechanism
- auction, asking the bet instead of your real evaluation

# (AGT11E4) [Game Theory] Mechanism Design Theory: The General Setting

2025/01/18

0000<->End

- ex-post concept
- matching problem has subscript
- voting problem, matching problem, auction problem
- auction environment, utility is transferable

# (AGT11E3) [Game Theory] Mechanism Design Example: Public Good Project

- indirectly revealing preference

- Erik Maskins, Nobel prize winner
- private information
- state 1 doesn't care about the future, state 2 care about the future
- prefer A to B
- having the participant telling the truth
