# (AGT11E6) [Game Theory] Mechanisms

2025/01/19

- social choice function is a mechanism
- M,g
- M stands for message space
- g is an outcome function
- g choose a social choice function
- g output D and Rn, which are the things needed for social choice function
- message in auction, the bet
- D in auction, choose winner
- Rn pays how much
- number of message may be different or more than preference, private theta

# (AGT11E7) [Game Theory] Dominant Strategy Mechanism Design

2025/01/19

- mechanism induce a game
- mi is a dominant strategy condition on theta i
- NE is not a strict dominant strategy
- g implement f in NE
- indirect mechanism
- auction, asking the bet instead of your real evaluation

- ex-post concept
- matching problem has subscript
- voting problem, matching problem, auction problem
- auction environment, utility is transferable

- Erik Maskins, Nobel prize winner
- private information
- state 1 doesn't care about the future, state 2 care about the future
- prefer A to B
- having the participant telling the truth

- seems the sign matters...

- transfer, threat
- incentive, persuation
- information is joint distribution of truth and data
- function, correspondence
- antecedent consequent
- change of a truth value must be justified by a rule
- there is some rule to change
- change simutaneously not sequencially
- antecedent must be kept as constant
