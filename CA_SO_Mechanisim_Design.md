# (AGT11E17) [Game Theory] Bilateral Trade: VCG Fails Budget Balancedness and Individual Rationality

2025/02/01

0000<->0800 End

- budget balanced
- individually rational
- step function
- budget balanced means sum of t is 0
- t<0 would make the mechanbism valid
- individual rationality
- let utility for each agent always greater than or equal to 0
- t<= secures DSIC
- VCG mehchanism in some circumstance could violate budget balanced and IR

- CG is not budget balanced in some setting
- budget balance is sum t< 0
- when considering transfer as a part of efficient
- utility of agent i <0, they wouldn't participate the game at the first place
- VCG is SP mechanism in quasi linear utility environment, u = v-t

- single peaked preferences, add some restriction to make the impossible possible
- type space is strict ranking over D
- D is which to choose in the end
- theta is type profile, instead of the order itself

# (AGT11E8) [Game Theory] Direct Mechanisms, Dominant Strategy IC, and Revelation Principle

2025/01/20

0000<->1000

- social choice function is a direct mechanism
- DSIC
- dominant strategy to tell truth regardless of what their true type is
- theta i is a dominant strategy at theta i, means telling the truth
- A SCF is strategy proof iff f is DSIC
- if it doesn't exist direct mechanism which is strategy proof , then there is no m,g implement f
- revealation principle for D.S.

# (AGT11E6) [Game Theory] Mechanisms

- g procduce an output or decision, which is which plant to be built given different input m(theta)
- social choice function is a mechanism
- M,g
- M stands for message space
- g is an outcome function
- g choose a social choice function
- g output D and Rn, which are the things needed for social choice function
- message in auction, the bet
- D in auction, choose winner
- Rn pays how much
- number of message may be different or more than preference, private theta

# (AGT11E7) [Game Theory] Dominant Strategy Mechanism Design

2025/01/19

- mechanism induce a game
- mi is a dominant strategy condition on theta i
- NE is not a strict dominant strategy
- g implement f in NE
- indirect mechanism
- auction, asking the bet instead of your real evaluation
