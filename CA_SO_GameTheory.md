- delta is to take probability distribution
- delta S, player can coordinate
- non coporate approach of game
- cooperate situation == good independent mixed strategy

- sigma i = set of mixed strategy of player i
- assign p1 for cooperate, assign p2 for defect
- pure strategy is a subset of mixed strategy
- mixed strategy SIGMA i sigama i
- pure strategy S si
- SIGMA and DELTA S are different set??
- strategy for player i
- when there is no subscript, it means a profile of strategies
