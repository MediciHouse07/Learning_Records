- among the remaining strategies
- only one unique strategy for each player, then the set would be called as solvable
- if keep waiting for emergent tech, nothing would be nailed down
- survive
- set of strategies within which it contains all strategies survives after all possible eliminations
- solvable if Si infinity is singleton
- {ui}
- G(N,S,{ui})
