### Lecture 2 <br>
2022/3/12:learned Lecture 2 quit at 30:55 <br>
Hope that I would note dive too deep into math learning things<br>
Lecture 2 is finished, continuous stuff
* f is differentiable, in other word, derivitave exists <br>
### Lecture 3 <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 3 01:36 , (cu)'=cu' <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 3 0753/4954 (sinx)' <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 3 1125/4954 (cosx)' <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 3 2119/4954 sin 0 ' and cos 0 ' at x=0 gives value of all sinx' and cosx', why? <br>
- 2022/03/14: No answer to this yet, sorry <br>

2022/03/14: Lecture 3 done, it is really interesting to know that proof can be done in geometric way <br>
### Lecture 4 <br>
2022/03/14: 1808/4602 derevative of product, derevative of quotient <br>
2022/03/14: finished <br>
### Lecture 5 <br>
### Lecture 16 <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 16 0638/4524, followed, but need further explaination
