- speed and velocity
- instantaneous velocity
- magnitude of velocity
- intrigue you
- a measurement is meaningless without understanding with error
- reletive error
- .0058 5.8 mili second
- TBRT shift 3 mins understand how to calculate error

- the third term is because g is given
- uncertainty, error
- how error would vary
