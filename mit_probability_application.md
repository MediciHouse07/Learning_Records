- random experiment indexed by time; infinite trials
- number of arrivals, number of matches?
- interarrival times is geometric distribution
- 0452 mins pascal PMF
- poisson process is continuous version of bernuli trials
- probability only depends on the length of tao
- delta is a small time interval

- stream send to different server
- probability p when there is a signal
- probability q sending to a server
- function of independent things are independent
- the last minutes is how to reason it is Bernoulli process

- this part need convolution

- first string of losing days
- geometric start from 1
- but L can't take 0
- having foresight would make it to be certain
- it turns out L is geometric with parameter p, instead of L+1
- the length of red colour L, not very follow why it can be used ,OK, it can have length 1 and in the mean time the structure is pertained

- string of losing days
- until the first success come
- geometric can't have it starting with 1
- sum of inter arrival times

- poisson process
- Markov chains with memory
- given number of time, how many jobs
- number of success S in n time slots
- number of time slots given unit arrival
- geometric distribution, 1-p to t-1 times p
- sequence of ones

- two rolling dices, think it as one experiment
- is different from
- tree based description
- infinite number of outcomes
- sample space is an infinite set
- one particular outcome

0600<->1600

- experiment->outcomes
- sample space, size of outcomes set
- sample space, set
- how to decide sample space and to what extend you abstract your model
