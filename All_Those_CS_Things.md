- 1638 mins, floating point

## Lecture 2

2022/07/23:

1500<->2600

- 1649 mins introduce why char can be interpreted as true

3639<->4041

- disassembler(object code to assembly code), reverse assembler (assembly code to object code)
- 4041 do the disassembler by self

2022/08/01:

2740<->3639

- shark machine, what is that

2022/08/01:

- register

# MAIN 2: Computer network

## Lecture 1

2022/07/23:

- 1-3

- connectionless, which means no end to end communication channel is built
- network simple lower cost to build, and faster
- internet is one communicaition system
- 1500 byte eithernet
- self contained data gram
- 32 bit address, 128 bit address
- protocol ID 6 tell data contain TCP, then they will parse in TCP
- protocol about how to parse

1-4

- syn, syn/ack, ack
- port is about which application
- wireshark
- 0606
- traceroute

1-5

- packet and speed
- treat each switching independently
- state
- stastical multiplexing


## Lecture 5

2022/07/23:

- 5-10

- recursive query
- name server, host name
- IP address of name server
- www.xxx is alias of some name
- canonical name
- MX records
- different types of record
- glue record, is to stick records
