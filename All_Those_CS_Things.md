1500<->2600

- 1649 mins introduce why char can be interpreted as true
- shift 8 bit might end with the original number, because of MOD
- 2540 mins, sign bit

0000<->1500

- 1100 mins inclusive or and exclusive or and other operations
- 1327 representation and operations and set

## Lecture 5

2022/08/01:

3639<->4041

- disassembler(object code to assembly code), reverse assembler (assembly code to object code)
- 4041 do the disassembler by self

2022/08/01:

2740<->3639

- shark machine, what is that

2022/08/01:

0000<->1500

# MAIN 2: Computer network

## Lecture 1

2022/07/23:

- 1-3

- connectionless, which means no end to end communication channel is built
- network simple lower cost to build, and faster
- internet is one communicaition system
- 1500 byte eithernet
- self contained data gram
- 32 bit address, 128 bit address
- protocol ID 6 tell data contain TCP, then they will parse in TCP
- protocol about how to parse

1-4

- syn, syn/ack, ack
- port is about which application
- wireshark
- 0606
- traceroute

1-5

- packet and speed
- treat each switching independently
- state
- stastical multiplexing

1-6

2022/08/02

- layer, it can be improved independently
- 

## Lecture 5

2022/07/23:

- 5-10

- recursive query
- name server, host name
- IP address of name server
- www.xxx is alias of some name
- canonical name
- MX records
- different types of record
- glue record, is to stick records

# MAIN 3: CS162 operating system

# Lecture1

2022/08/02:

1500<->2033

- type drive, store things in type

2022/07/22:

0000<->1500

# Ext1: CS143 compiler

## Lecture 1

2022/07/22:
### Section 1,1
- Formulas translated, FORTRAN


# Ext2: System security

# Ext3: CMU database I 15-445

## Lecture 1

2022/10/02

3953<->4400

- structure, integrity, manipulation
- n-ary relation = table n columns
- tuple

2022/09/30

2525<-> 3953

- some problems how to handle in flat file structure
- durability
- software can work with a database and doesn't need to know the underlying things within the database
- DBMS is software
- 1970s people re-write database again and again
- relational model is to resolve above problem
- 3253 mins 2 papers
- different data structure leads to different API for example who to delete a group of data, tree structure, hash structure and so on
- database can envovle itself without creating any effect to applications
- relational model can be used to model anything, for example unstructured model

2022/09/29

0327<->2525

- other database courses 0452 mins
- 0623<->1800 jumped book recommend
- inter-related data that models some aspect of the real world
- flat file example


# Ext3: CMU database II 15-721

## Lecture 1

2022/09/29

2000<->2353

- start with thanks to SAP
- OK he will introduce SAP HANA paper
- 1970 first database
- seems this is not a junior course
