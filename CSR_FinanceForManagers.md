2023/01/27

- recap

## 1-4

2023/03/02

- every day of delay of payment has a financial impact
- think in sustainable growth way, they grow too much the slope of NOF is much higher than the slope of WC

2023/01/27

- everyday of delay in DOC may have financial impact
- operational ratio is bad

## 1-5

2023/03/03

- assume they can manage DOC well
- what if not to use deteriorated ratios
- even in the good policy, the problem won't be solved as well
- as we grow, the NOF grows faster than WC

2023/01/27

- suppose to use another ratios to do the forecast
- for example, the ratios they committed
- doesn't solve the problem
- even with good policies the problem is still there
- so why
- as they grow, the needs of funds are growing faster than working capital, NOF > WC

- long term financing minus fixed assets
- NFO needs of funds, WC source of funds

## 1-7

2023/03/05

- credit line is extra piece outside of NFO and WC, it is on the liability side
- because 5 is not enough to finance 10
- WC another definition current asset minus current liability
- not current, not asset

2023/01/28

- simplified structure to BS
- WC is stable, not that current


## 1-8

2023/03/05

- NOF for operations, WC capital left after financing the fixed asset

- 3% might result in negative profit

## 1-10

2023/03/08

- inventory is a competitive advantage of the company in the example
- payable
- days of XXX is about policy of company
- payable, we pay in cash, 2% discount if we pay in cash
- get financing from the bank, and pay supplier in cash in the beginning
- discount to pay early means charging us for not paying cash

2023/01/28

- strategic advantage is the inventory
- early payment to the suppliers
- get financing from the bank pay the supplier in cash in the beginning
