Use GPU run the 3850 to 7000
Attempt to use model trained with last year applying to the new year

09:20

GPU run into error as not call GPU at every step

09:30

Moved to GPU but seems at a wrong place

09:40

Test inference model, with existing setup then try to use the embedding others created


09:50

code running successfully
need to understand the 3 categories,e.g. BPO, where is data is from test-ii ipynb

13:39

Downloaded the fourth solution and try to enable it

13:49

no progress

13:59

running ankh embedding now

14:09

anhk embedding is running, length is also identified

14:19

train and infer seems can work with anhk embedding only, though there was also other embedding being used
preprocess data, not sure where it was from or can it be resuable for this competition
waiting for the result from the embedding

09:12

Checked second solution in last year

09:22

no output, be distracted

09:32

3rd solution, with graph, you can mimic it

I don't know it was because of a sip of coffee or what, but I was close to cry while I was reading the 4th tolution writeup, maybe because its sincere and honest

check if the naive embedding technically possible
realized to also check the stats for null value

08:12

still working on the same thing, got an understanding of a characteristic of the group

08:22



08:32

understand RAM size

08:42

adjust the parameter to best fit RAM

12:57

understand the admin procedure of the competition

13:07

understood how the admin procedure would be managed

13:17

embed cafa6 test superset data

13:27

understand more about cafa6 competition, record are all in medici copilot

13:37

try the embedding approach for fun

13:42

25 mins out of time due to computationally heavy, and distraction from environment, searching for a headset

Vectorization can let your code run on parrallel compute hardware

tilted to the left or tilted to the right
given state, pick action to maximize the return, with discount fator


09:34

deep reinforcement learning
s,a based Q formula, to tell it what action and state combination rewards

09:44

deep Q network
DQN
take a long time to converge


09:54

picking action randomly, aka, exploration
greedy action
exploitation
epsilon greedy policy
