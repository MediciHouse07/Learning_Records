- A register
- M register
- A instruction, set A register to RAM 21
- @100,M=-1
- C instruction, workhouse
- dest = comp ; jump
- The JEQ jump directive is activated, so the next instruction will be the value stored in A.

- create, move, chunk of 16 bit
- ROM, is instruction memory
- instruction buses, data buses, address buses
- ROM is an abbreviation of read only memory
- maybe because it was a place stores instruction

- cost performance tradeoff
- arithmetic operations, logical operations, flow control
- access memory is expensive, need to supply a long address, getting the memory contents into the CPU take time
- memory hierarchy
- registers (in CU), cache, main memory, disk
- disk is also considered as memory

- Turing, theory
- von Neumann, practice
- memory including program and data
- compilation is from machine language to high level language, java or python; assembler assembly language they are not high level language
- 0100010 0011 0010
- ADD R3 R2
- True or False: complier would translate high level language to machine language, assembler would translate assembly language to machine language
Coach
True. 
A compiler translates high-level programming languages (like Java or Python) into machine language.
An assembler translates assembly language (a low-level language) into machine language.
This distinction is important in understanding how programs are executed on a computer.

- 1970s IBM apple, first PC, no software on them
- pascal run on mainframe
- different pascal compiler
- IBM apple have no interest to help developer to port their software on other company's machine
- translate P code to intel IBM, another P code translate to mortorola CPU apple
- pascal complier generate P code
- same pascal program on both IBM and Apple
- P code implementation can be easily downloaded and installed by then
