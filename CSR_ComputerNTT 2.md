- JAVA byte code JAVA JVM
- hack VM 16 digits, it can only recognize integer
- both are stack base

- business and office application
- a universal VM architecture that can run on all the machines
- cross platform compitability
- nothing can stop a good idea, it has a life of its own
- sluggish
- stack vs register machine, register machine are more applicable for mobile devices

0000<->0806

- 1970s IBM apple, first PC, no software on them
- pascal run on mainframe
- different pascal compiler
- IBM apple have no interest to help developer to port their software on other company's machine
- translate P code to intel IBM, another P code translate to mortorola CPU apple
- pascal complier generate P code
- same pascal program on both IBM and Apple
- P code implementation can be easily downloaded and installed by then
