## Week1-1-7 About the course

- canonical

## Week1-1-8 merge and sort motivation

2023/07/17

- 1945
- paradiagm
- better than selection, insertion, bubble sorts
- quaradic dependence on the input
- asymptotic analysis
- recursive, function keep calling itself on smaller group

2023/07/14

- in practice
- on the web
- intimating

## Week1-1-9 merge and sort pseudo code

2023/07/18

- tranverse
- recursive should give an exponential
- but every time with half of the size
- other algorithm is quardic
- n times log n is better than constant times n square

# Week1-1-(-1) Guiding principles

2023/07/19

- average case
- bench marks

# Week1-2-2

2023/08/03

- n0 quantify sufficiently large
- costant means they are independent of n

# Week1-2-3

2023/08/03
- worst case analysis
- require domain knowledge
- asymtotic analysis
- paradigm
- sweet spot

# Week1-2-4

2023/08/04

- big o, big omega, big theta
- big omega lower bounded
- theta equal
- both big o and big omega
