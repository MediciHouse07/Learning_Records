DERIVED
what do I need, say, suppose there is a boundary for my study, what would be the topic, network is yes, computer is yes

what else

what is a simplified version

gateway

but suppose one course a month.

at 2 months to go, 2 course about computer will be done
and it would take 1 month to finish a network course

I guess another 3 months to finish CS princeton
3 months to finish algorithm, 3 month to finish Crypton, but anyway it would end in a year

So, no matter you think this is long or short, it would take 1 year.
Can you do something now, without the help of completing them right now

Or, is there any way that you can make the progress faster
Of course without losing the quality of the study
