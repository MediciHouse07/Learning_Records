4300<->5500

- review prove by contradiction, review prove induction
- assumption about statement p
- want to assume negation of the conclusion is true, then reach out to a false statement
- rules of logic
- you can't derive a wrong statement from a right statement
- start from a true asumption, derive a false statement
- from the assumption, we derive 2 statements, it has a least element in S, and the element is not in S

0000<->1500

- gain experience with proofs
- prove statements about the real numbers, functions, limits
- propoer subset of B
- inclusion
- N<Z<Q<R<C, the post equation was introduced when peole can't solve the prior equation, for example people can't solve x^2+1=0, then people introduce the set C, and x^2+1=3 in Q, people introduced R

- cantor
- continum hypothesis

10900<->11600

2023/05/17

- |Q|=|N|
- proof sketch
- not to use the same letter
- another set has bijection to the natural number, thus it is countable
- prove the above through Z

10200<->10900

2023/05/14

- |positive rational number|=|N|
- forgo
- Rk
- prime number divided by another prime number, unique

5700<->10200

2023/05/13

- practice proof of |Z|=|N|

5100<->5700

2023/05/12

- changing letter doesn't change the set
- inconsequential
- simply by definition
- then there exist

3600<->5100

2023/05/05

- when there is bijection
- bijection, and inverse of bijection, this he left as exercise

2600<->3600

2023/05/04

- absolute value looking
- A is finite
- Cantoz-Schrod-Bernstein
- statement about cardinality
- process of counting
- countable set, pair element in a set A with N, if A has the same size as N, then it is countably infinite
- if A is finite or ctbly infinite we say A is countable
- if not countable, then A is uncountable

2023/05/02

1100<->2600

- f is injective or 1-1
- understand surjective
- definition for injective, surjective, bijective
- map that is surjective is sujection
- respectively
- inverse function exist only for bijective function
- inverse image always exist
- bijection, bijective function, when we mean paired off
- have the same cardinality if exist bijection from A to B
- synomy, map, function

2023/05/01

0000<->1100

- paired off
- when elements of the two sets can be paired off
- therom of cardinality
- function match x belongs A to a unique element in B fx belongs to B
- inverse image always exist, inverse function may not exist

2023/04/12

4900<->End

- injection, if fn1=fn2 then n1=n2
- is onto
- injection + onto is bijection
- by the definition
- 2 sets have the same cardinality
- |Z|=|N|
- FTArithmatric
- prime number
- 10700 mins, rational number example
- countably infinite
- |N|<|A|? A is uncountable
- power set of A
- empty set has no member, power set of empty set has 1 member
- 12200 mins, Candor
- continuum hypothesis

2023/04/11

3900<->4900

- bijection from A to B, bijection from B to A is the inverse
- bijection f A to B, bijection g B to C
- 3 gets mapped to
- prove a constructed function is a bijection
- because g is 1-1, thus f is 1 to 1
- injective and surjetive

0000<->3900

2023/04/10

- does R and N have the same set
- when do 2 sets A and B have the same size?
- Cantor
- when the elements of the 2 size can be paired off
- Theory of cardinality
- review termnology function
- A B are set, f A->B
- naive definition
- injective
- surjective or onto
- st, so that
- bijective, 1-1 and onto
- surjection is a map of surjective
- composition of function
- inverse only defined for bijective function
- inverse of function, inverse of set
- inverse image of a set
- bijection, bijective function
- have the same cardinality, if bijection, or bijective function from A to B
- set have the same cardinality
- |A|=|B|, shorthand for saying the 2 sets have the same cardinality
- Cantoz-Schrodu-Bxxxx
- statement about cardinality
- pair off with natural number, countable set
- countably infinite
- if A is finite or countably infinite
- countable
- otherwise we say A is uncountable

# Lecture 3

1500<->3000

2023/05/25

- cantor therom and I am a lier vs I am not a lier
- define less than relation by using N for Z and Q
- relation and order

2023/05/21

0000<->1500

- Thm cantor, about the set

0000<->1500

2023/04/23

- power set of A is the set of sub set
- Cantor
- mind buggling
- 2 sets are equal when their element are equal
- 1 to 1
- injective implies ||<=||
- 1 to 1 is different things in that to different thing in another that
- with the assumption, a strange set will be generated, thus the assumption is false
