2500<->3500

- therom, if P then Q
- trace what this mean
- set thinking, boolean thinking, word thinking, venn thinking, hold the proof target in mind

2023/04/10

4300<->5500

- review prove by contradiction, review prove induction
- assumption about statement p
- want to assume negation of the conclusion is true, then reach out to a false statement
- rules of logic
- you can't derive a wrong statement from a right statement
- start from a true asumption, derive a false statement
- from the assumption, we derive 2 statements, it has a least element in S, and the element is not in S

5400<->End

- use induction therom to prove some other things
- base case, inductive step
- algebric, inequality can be used
- calculus things can't be used

2023/04/09

3500<->5400

- Induction
- Axiom, well ordering property of N
- principle
- Pascal
- proof by contradiction
- assume negation of the proof
- from that derive a false statement
- from a true statement can't derive a false statement
- rules of logic
- 4800 mins proof by contradiction
- -><- contradiction sign

2400<->3500

- WTS: want to show
- let x in ...

1500<->2500

- number system
- union, intersection
- wrt, with respect to
- A\B, x in A and x not in B
- Ac complement
- complement 2100 lectuer can't distinguish
- 2300 mins, first real analysis proof

2023/04/07

0000<->1500

- gain experience with proofs
- prove statements about the real numbers, functions, limits
- propoer subset of B
- inclusion
- N<Z<Q<R<C, the post equation was introduced when peole can't solve the prior equation, for example people can't solve x^2+1=0, then people introduce the set C, and x^2+1=3 in Q, people introduced R

- injection, if fn1=fn2 then n1=n2
- is onto
- injection + onto is bijection
- by the definition
- 2 sets have the same cardinality
- |Z|=|N|
- FTArithmatric
- prime number
- 10700 mins, rational number example
- countably infinite
- |N|<|A|? A is uncountable
- power set of A
- empty set has no member, power set of empty set has 1 member
- 12200 mins, Candor
- continuum hypothesis

2023/04/11

3900<->4900

- bijection from A to B, bijection from B to A is the inverse
- bijection f A to B, bijection g B to C
- 3 gets mapped to
- prove a constructed function is a bijection
- because g is 1-1, thus f is 1 to 1
- injective and surjetive

0000<->3900

- does R and N have the same set
- when do 2 sets A and B have the same size?
- Cantor
- when the elements of the 2 size can be paired off
- Theory of cardinality
- review termnology function
- A B are set, f A->B
- naive definition
- injective
- surjective or onto
- st, so that
- bijective, 1-1 and onto
- surjection is a map of surjective
- composition of function
- inverse only defined for bijective function
- inverse of function, inverse of set
- inverse image of a set
- bijection, bijective function
- have the same cardinality, if bijection, or bijective function from A to B
- set have the same cardinality
- |A|=|B|, shorthand for saying the 2 sets have the same cardinality
- Cantoz-Schrodu-Bxxxx
- statement about cardinality
- pair off with natural number, countable set
- countably infinite
- if A is finite or countably infinite
- countable
- otherwise we say A is uncountable
- 3400 mins even integer, odd integer are countable
- Richard feyman
- bijective function from one set to another

- power set of A is the set of sub set
- Cantor
- mind buggling
- 2 sets are equal when their element are equal
- 1 to 1
- injective implies ||<=||
- 1 to 1 is different things in that to different thing in another that
- with the assumption, a strange set will be generated, thus the assumption is false
