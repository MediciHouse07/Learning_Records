- rule and behaviour
- moral incentive
- incentive change preference

- it is a very nice condition
- robot, preference relation, individual, behave the same way
- consistent way of choice
- Ariel Rubinstein
- standard money pumping game, such living wouldn't exist
- think about small amount of money to select an alternative

- download speed
- conditional statement
- is at least as good as y, XRy
- binary tanstivity property was introduced in the math review

- all = every
- there are relaxation
- all definition are if and only if statement
- corollary
- >=-minimal
- >=maximal
- if >= X finite, then >= has utility representation

- lexicgonaphic preferences
- dictionary analogy
- can't be represented by utility function
- remaining set is not compact
- bounded but not closed
- preference continuous preference, and X is metric space
- thus it has continuous utility
- what does continuous preference mean is
- Debreu's theorom
- continuous preference, no jump, all of a sudden there will not be reverse

- lexicponaphic preference
- continuous preference
- x1 is nonempty
- |x| is less than infinity

- rational choice
- 2 to the X, all subset of X
- induced choice function always pick the best
- choice only choose one element from A
- it takes subset as input and return one element from the set
- condition alpha
- AS IF

- rational vs rationalizable
- want to be distractive
- leave a space here
- look at the story as if Bob is maximizing
- rational doesn't mean the literal meaning of rational

- continuous preference
- 0600 mins alternative and bundles
- in consumer theory, price are excluded
- only quantity of goods are included

- alternatives
- walking distance

- in definition, it is iff
- if and only if means <=>
- any 2 real number are comparable

- criteria, jump to the next step by step

- you can fix notation
- you can't fix value
- exhanstive cases
- these 4 cases cover everything

## 10

- it is strictly better
- to the right of it
- lexicographical peference
- lexicography

0000<->0400

2023/05/09

- define continuity
- X is metric space with proper property
- continuity can only be defined on metric space

# 11

2023/05/11

- >= is defined on reals
- at least as good as can be defined on anything
- 0340 mins define when a vector is greater than or equal to another vector
- define a choice behaviour that satisfies condition alpha
- to prove this statement "at least as good sign iff one vector is greater than or equal to another vector"
- hunch
- either this or this is equivalent to either this is true or this is true
- define a preference relation in a random way

## 12

- assume for conditional derivation
- by definition

0000<->1600

- joint improvement is impossible
- an allocation is Pareto efficient
- Pareto efficient aims at not to make an investment that won't create value
