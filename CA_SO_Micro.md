# (M8E4) [Microeconomics] Pareto Efficiency (Optimality)

1200<->1500

2024/10/03

- make xx happier, make yy worse off

0000<->1200

2024/10/02

- allocation , it is impossible to make one person better off without making another person worse off
- better off, we talk about preference and utility
- assume more money is better than less money, how the pareto works
- check a therom in the conditions of different assumptions
- this allocation, this way of splitting money is inefficient
- they both prefer A allocation than B allocation
- so a pareto efficient is also a common goal
