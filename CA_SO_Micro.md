- lexicgonaphic preferences
- dictionary analogy
- can't be represented by utility function
- remaining set is not compact
- bounded but not closed
- preference continuous preference, and X is metric space
- thus it has continuous utility
- what does continuous preference mean is
- Debreu's theorom
- continuous preference, no jump, all of a sudden there will not be reverse
