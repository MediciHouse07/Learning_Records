- kink point moves on a straight line
- 2 unknowns, 2 equations
- in the case where lagerangee doesn't help, use substitution approach
- using 2 property, both term equal give you the array where the kink point move

## 9

2023/05/22

- max case, one equation 2 unknown
- lagrangeen is necessary solution, is not sufficient
- perfect substitution

2023/04/07

0000<->1600

- joint improvement is impossible
- an allocation is Pareto efficient
- Pareto efficient aims at not to make an investment that won't create value
