- conservative and path independent are equivalent
- a different way of thinking about the situation
- and it is equivalent to say F is a gradient field

- path independence
- for gradient field
- if c1 and c2 have the same start and end points
- gradient field is conservative
- an example of vector field that is not conservative
- not it doesn't have the same answer for the same starting point and ending point
- force F
- potential f
- gradient of f = F
- conservativeness means no energy can be extracted from the field for free

- f is potential, delta f is gradient field
- FTC for line integral
- whether a vector field is gradient
- understand FTC for line integral, f=xy is an example of F

- find the work done along the curve by the vector field
- M N are component of vector field
- integral of y dx + x dy what is that???
- it may come from the formula of the vector field
- understand that as integral of (y dx + x dy)

- differentiable and My=Mx then F is gradient field
- it should be the same in everywhere
- you can't assign x=0 to make it equal in everywhere
