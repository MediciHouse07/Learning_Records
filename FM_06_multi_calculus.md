2022/03/27: ðŸ’« finished,  but skipped the contow part, I think I learned it before

3000<->End

- 2 by 2 linear system
- solve the linear system you get the best fit line
- and the cost function will give you a minimum result
- transistor
- exponential relation between transistors and time
- OLS is more general
- best exponential fit y=ce^ax
- 4726 mins
- transform exponential to linear
- quadratic law
- solve for 3 by 3 linear system, which means it has 3 parameters

1500<->3000

- 2308 mins complete the square

2022/09/29

0000<->1500

- delta z is roughly equal to fx delta x + fy delta y
- tanget plane to the surface
- express the formula in linear way
- cross product
- close enough the roughly equal turns to be equal
- application find min/max

### Lecture 10

2022/11/16

3700<->End

- linear approximation
- taylor approximation for one variable
- analogy to 2 variable calculas
- general case reduces to quadradic case
- 4640 mins example
- A is positive, AC-Bsquare>0
- critical point and boundary 0 and infinity

2022/11/15

3000<->4500

- 3357 mins, maximum, minimum
- AC-Bsquare
- 4ac-bsquare
- 4051 mins, taylor series and quadratic approximation
- approximation doesn't apply to degenerate case

2022/11/14

1500<->3000

- 4ac - b2
- if it is less than 0 then there is saddle point
- if it is 0, degenerate critical point
- degenerate means on a certain direction nothing is happened
- next step second derivative, how many second derivative do we have

2022/11/13

0000<->1500

- complete a square
- general version
- sum of 2 square, origin is the minimam
- difference of 2 square, there will be a saddle point

### Lecture 11

2023/01/07

1500<->3000

- divide by dt, get chain rule
- when delta t tend to 0, delta turns to derivative
- TBRT

2023/01/06

0000<->1500

- differentials
- dy=f'xdx
- use inverse function to derive the derivative for a complex formula
- df=fxdx+fydy+fzdz
- df is not a number
- differential as a placeholder
- how changes in x y z affect f
- placeholder for small variation delta x delta y delta z to get appro formula delta f r equal fxdeltax
- the rate of change dy/dt, divide by something like dt to get a rate of change
- if they are all function of t
- d and delta don't live in the same world
