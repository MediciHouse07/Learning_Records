- 2 by 2 linear system
- solve the linear system you get the best fit line
- and the cost function will give you a minimum result
- transistor
- exponential relation between transistors and time
- OLS is more general
- best exponential fit y=ce^ax
- 4726 mins
- transform exponential to linear
- quadratic law
- solve for 3 by 3 linear system, which means it has 3 parameters

- delta z is roughly equal to fx delta x + fy delta y
- tanget plane to the surface
- express the formula in linear way
- cross product
- close enough the roughly equal turns to be equal
- application find min/max
