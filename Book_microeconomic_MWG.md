- x is weakly preferred to y
- adhere to
- preorder
- weak order, complete preorder, rational preference relation
- >= is relexive is implied by the completeness, so it is redundant

- practice proof 1.B.1 i and ii, proof by contraction is frequently used
- perceptible
- just perceptible difference

- far from common experience
- forgo
- proof of 1.B.1 i, transitive, use 3 option and only one left approach, I think it is another form of proof by contradiction

- condorcet paradox
- manifestation
- abstince
- change of taste

- commitment in decision making
- In Greek mythology, Ulysses (also known as Odysseus) was a hero and the king of Ithaca. One of his most famous adventures was his encounter with the Sirens.

The Sirens were beautiful, half-bird, half-woman creatures who lived on an island surrounded by dangerous rocks. They sang enchanting songs that were so beautiful that sailors passing by would be lured towards the island, causing their ships to crash on the rocks and resulting in their deaths.

When Ulysses and his crew sailed past the Sirens' island, he wanted to hear their beautiful songs but was afraid that he and his crew would be lured to their deaths. So he came up with a plan.

He ordered his men to plug their ears with beeswax so that they wouldn't be able to hear the Sirens' songs, and he had them tie him to the mast of the ship. He instructed his crew to ignore his pleas to be released, no matter how much he begged or threatened them.

As they sailed past the Sirens' island, Ulysses heard their enchanting songs and begged to be released, but his crew ignored his pleas and kept rowing. Eventually, they sailed out of earshot, and Ulysses was saved from the Sirens' deadly spell.

Thanks to his cunning plan, Ulysses and his crew were able to safely pass by the Sirens' island and continue their journey home. The story of Ulysses and the Sirens has become a classic tale of the power of temptation and the strength of willpower.

- if a preference want to be represented by utility function, then it must be bounded by completeness and transivity
- utility representitive infers rational, but the reverse is not true
- choice structure

- invariant and ordinal, strictly increasing transformation
- cardinal properties
- proof of when a preferene relation can be represented
- If we phrase the statement "a preference relation can be represented by a utility function only if it is rational" as an "if-then" statement, we get:

"If a preference relation can be represented by a utility function, then it is rational."

In this case, the antecedent "a preference relation can be represented by a utility function" is the "if" part or the "p" part of the statement, and the consequent "it is rational" is the "then" part or the "q" part of the statement.
- antecident versus consequent
