1124 mins, epusilon, delta q/Q0/delta p/P0, <=0;

20220522:


0000<->3000

0000 mins;

- Derive demand curve
- opportunite set is larger
- shape of demand curve, determined by elasticity of demand
- elsticity <= 0
- delta q/ q0 / delta p/ p0
- elasticity = 0 perfect inelastic
- 

1500 mins;

- perfect elasticity demand, = infinite; perfect substitutes
- they increase price a little bit, you lose all the business;
- Income shifts
- Engel curve
- gamma = delta Q/Q0/delta Y/Y0, income, put denominator to be income;
- local? constant elasticity curve?
- normal goods, postive engel curve, luxuries, >1 gamma, neccessity
- gamma < 0 , inferior goods
- response to price change, 1. income effect, 2. substitution effect

3000 mins;

- slope of new budege constraint, tagent with the old indifferent curve
- hold utility constant, compensate demand
- substitution effect is always negative when price is increase
- if the good is inferior, income effect and substitution effect are on the different direction
- effective income, price increase you are actually poorer, your opportunity set shrink
- upward sloping demand curve, giffen good
- you give them more coupon money of a good, then the good is getting cheaper for them, they go to another good, TBRT
