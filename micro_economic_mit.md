1755 mins, ordinal(doesn't have sense) and cardinal(has some sense);
1842 mins, MU, diminishing MU;
2500 mins, MRS, marginal rate of substitution; MRS has to diminish;
2905 mins, the more you have a thing, the less you want it.
3025 mins, convex to original, indifference curve; TBRT;

2022/05/19:
0000<->3400
0330 mins, preference assumption;
model rely on assumptions;
only one IC through all bundle, completeness, and the other 2 assumtions can gurantee this;
ordernal, is rank, cardinal, it has meaning;
MU is next unit;
2308 mins barf;

- MRS;
- diminishing marginal utility cause 2-1 to 1-2

3300 mins;

- adiction things is because utility shift

- a little bit of money can double the next of unit;
- perishable;

2022/05/14:
0000<->1500
0100 mins, constraints;
0542 mins, MRT transformation, MRS substitutes;
0702 mins, opportunity cost is best alternative you can get;
1000 mins, budget constraint gives you transformation;
1233 mins, opportunity set;
1430 mins, pivot??; pivoting invert, TBRT

2022/05/15:
1500<->End
1930 mins, tangency between budget line and indifference curve;
2050 mins, point X dominate point Y;
2251 mins, MRS = MRT, fundamental conclusion of consumer choice; this is also ratio of benefits = ratio of cost; it can be re-write and get a more intuitive equation;
3000 mins, what you want to give up to gain, and what market asked;
3032 mins, this part is core of consumer theory TBRT;
3136 mins, poverty line, how many resources you need to live in somewhere;
3200 mins, SNAP;
3558 mins, food stamp;
4000 mins, people know best, or gov know best;
4130 mins, paternalistic;
4437 mins, black market;

0000 mins;

- Y = Pp * P + Pc * C;
- slope of budget constraint line, MRT, -Pc/Pp;
- opportunity cost, next best alternative;
- impose a budeget, opitimize, tradeoff;
- comparative stats, heared of this term in game theory;
- opportunity set, shrink;
- 

1500 mins

- market control the slope, you can control the level;
- utility function is the source of indifference curve, and the later can represent the prior;
- it is easy to say if I want next piece of pizza, and did market allow you do;
- the rate you want to trade is the rate the market allow you;
- re-write the function, marginal hapiness per money equals;
- Mup = du/dp
- MRS=-2.5, you are willing to give 2.5 pizza to one pizza, market charge 1/2, then you will go to D point;

3000 mins

- MB=MC, marginal benefit, marginal cost, MRS=MRT;
- type 1 player were forced to equalibrium, ot as happy as they can freely choose;
- if people knew best;
- no market failure, no paternalistic, you will give the poor money;
- empirical economic; theory first, and test it;

# Lecture 4
2022/05/15:
0000<->1500
0530 mins, opportunity cost/set;
0800 mins, derive demand curve from indifference curve(utility function) and budget constraint;
1058 mins, elasticity determines the shape of demand curve;
1124 mins, epusilon, delta q/Q0/delta p/P0, <=0;

20220522:


0000<->3000

0000 mins;

- Derive demand curve
- opportunite set is larger
- shape of demand curve, determined by elasticity of demand
- elsticity <= 0
- delta q/ q0 / delta p/ p0
- elasticity = 0 perfect inelastic
- 

1500 mins;

- perfect elasticity demand, = infinite; perfect substitutes
- they increase price a little bit, you lose all the business;
- Income shifts
- Engel curve
- gamma = delta Q/Q0/delta Y/Y0, income, put denominator to be income;
- local? constant elasticity curve?
- normal goods, postive engel curve, luxuries, >1 gamma, neccessity
- gamma < 0 , inferior goods
- response to price change, 1. income effect, 2. substitution effect
- 

3000 mins;

2022/05/23:

finished,
3000<->End

3000 mins;

- slope of new budege constraint, tagent with the old indifferent curve
- hold utility constant, compensate demand
- substitution effect is always negative when price is increase
- if the good is inferior, income effect and substitution effect are on the different direction
- effective income, price increase you are actually poorer, your opportunity set shrink
- upward sloping demand curve, giffen good
- you give them more coupon money of a good, then the good is getting cheaper for them, they go to another good, TBRT
