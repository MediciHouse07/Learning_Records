- symmetric matrix has all real lambas
- columns are multiple of this one, rows are multiple of that one

- orthornomal, unit orthagnal; orthagnal is perpendicular
- QR Gram Schmidt
- S stand for semitric
- Q eigen vectors, A is lambda
- eigen vectros are orthognals

- random vector, to know what the column space look like
- putting parenthethis to different places for linear algebra
- row reduced epsilon form of matrix
- identity and column that tell you the right combination
- A=CR, A=CUR’ R’ has independent rows pick from the matrix

# Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

- column space, range?
- random sampling of a matrix

# Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

- row space of A, is column space of transpose of A
- matrices is not likely to be square
- row is in R3, and column also happen in R3 in this case
- why the two rows are basis of the row space
- basis has to be independent, and their combination produce all the rows

# Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

2200<->2700

- column rank = row rank
- so row wise it has to be dependent

- basis
- rank can be deemed as number of independent columns
- independent and combination has to flll the space, make it to be a basis
- basis C
- column rank
- A C R
- basis and coordinates, basis transformation

- column space of A, line, rank of A = 1, dimension of column space
- only two columns can enable a matrix of rank 2
- rank one matrices, building block of data science
- column times row

# Lecture 1: The Column Space of A Contains All Vectors Ax

0500<->1000

- 1) dot product 2) vector approach 3)
- think of a matrix as a thing
- think of Ax combination of columns of A
- all Ax column space of A
