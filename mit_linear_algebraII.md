- data comes in matrices, but not in the form of square
- basis for row spaces
- basis for column spaces
- basis, independent, combination produce all the rows
- range
- 10 to the fifth
- take a mixture of columns
- it blocks it
- R is row reduced echelon form

- when A is not invertible, A is a singular matrix, x is in the null space of A
- TBR eigen vector, e to the At; TBR eigen vector as a basis for any vector
- difference equation
- you can also pass through anyway
