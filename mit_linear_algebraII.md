- column rank = row rank
- so row wise it has to be dependent

- basis
- rank can be deemed as number of independent columns
- independent and combination has to flll the space, make it to be a basis
- basis C
- column rank
- A C R
- basis and coordinates, basis transformation

- column space of A, line, rank of A = 1, dimension of column space
- only two columns can enable a matrix of rank 2
- rank one matrices, building block of data science
- column times row

0500<->1000

- 1) dot product 2) vector approach 3)
- think of a matrix as a thing
- think of Ax combination of columns of A
- all Ax column space of A

- data comes in matrices, but not in the form of square
- basis for row spaces
- basis for column spaces
- basis, independent, combination produce all the rows
- range
- 10 to the fifth
- take a mixture of columns
- it blocks it
- R is row reduced echelon form
