- B occurs tell you nothing about probability of A
- mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets
- sets are exclusive sets, intersection of sets are also exclusive sets
- false positive, false negative

- generating random draw is in the previous lecture, program lecture 5
- xx task due Wed
- probability integral transformation
- induced support
- from uniorm to any continuous distribution

- for at least in my opinion
- independent
- if we know one occur, it tells us noting of whether the other event would occur
- apply probability in number of success shooting

- data analysis as a pre-alert to standard research
- population growth
- there are many factors, but to tell story you can have the data back you
- the stickness of human behavior, without a physical school, you don't call it study
- physical buildings which looks useless to me have a significant level of importance to them
- data analysis as a pre-alert sometimes may be the standard research due to sociology can't be put into an experiment
- hidden variable

- audits, backcheckes
- reported pollution, actual pollution
- treatment group, control group
- firm is not human, you can collect more data than human
- downside, upside
- autism

1000<->2500

2024/07/05

- audit
- social science can't work with experiment, that might be another reason that data analyst can come in and play a role, as economic is more like a data analyst but with more time

- if you breathe them, when you breathe them
- degree of node, in plain English
- 0950 mins, data analysis way of interpretating things

- the simple sample space can meet the axiom of probability, that is one of its base
- license plate
- license plate can have with replacement and without replacement
- exclaimation
- ordered arrangement of objects
- order mattered is called permutation
- unordreed mattered is called combination
- 3000 mins, participated factorial story
-

- finance, gamble, insurance
- set theory in probability theory
- where set theory and probability deviates
- probability would describe intersection without notation, using AB only
- disjoint, mutually exclusive
- exhausted, union is the sample space
- mutually exclusive and exhaustive
- the formula for probability complement is useful because sometimes it is hard to calculate the complement
- check if a function is a probability, ana it to check if it is a utility function
- simple sample space, is useful for experiment
