# Notes
2rd rule should be noticed <br>
2022/03/25: Adjustment about the rule: If you always jump video from one to another you use this 💫, other wise you don't need, for example, you jump to the next ten, then you learn the lesson after that course, you don't need to put a 💫 on it <br>

# Direction of my research
### Supply side(what is the topic researchers on the field chasing):
Find what are the topics people discuss most in the field of de-fi, finance, sociology, pltc-science,economy, econometrics. <br>
List them, and find is there any subject interest you, if there is, find relavant articles and read them, if meet question, study it, publish it when done.
If there is no interesting subject, you have to come up with one yourself.
Anyway, your own interdispline will be solidify by this activity.
### Supply side(What is my interest)
- Exchange rate, ex rate basket, relation of them
- Crypto currency and macro economy
- Technique and economy
- Theory and economy, or other ideas listed in VIC2
- M0 M1 M2 etc, through each countries
- Size of capital market, stock market, bond market, equity market, etc all over the world
- Financial instrument at each of the level, O/N CB rate, term loan, SWAP, CDS, etc. how they flow from one country to another

### Ideal condition
It is better to find an intersection between demand and supply and other meaningful parts <br>
