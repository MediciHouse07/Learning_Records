### Lecture 1
2022/03/13: mumbling mumbling, but OK, 1930/010029 <br>

### Lecture 2
2022/03/17:ðŸ’« 2058/011236 stop at conjugate matrix, I don't what property it has <br>
2022/03/18:ðŸ’« 2538/011236 stop at SVD, from 20-25 is diagnolization matrix and its property  <br>
2022/03/18:ðŸ’« this video can explain conjugate matrix, Hermitian matrices ?A=A^H=A^-^T? take conjugate then take transpose https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYS9EYZ3gCo
### Lecture 3
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« skip to tailor expectation things, stuck there, then went to check Lecture 9 in [Expectation 9 and 10 110](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/statistics_110.md#lecture-9-) <br>
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« Moment Generation Function, how to understand that easily? maybe need to check 110 as well Lecture 17 and Lecture 18 <br>
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« Moment Generation Function, get an idea of MGF Lecture 17 and Lecture 18, and the taylor something is just taylor series [Lecture 17&18](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/statistics_110.md#lecture-17-) <br>
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« Chef inequality, get an idea of inequality Lecture 28 and Lecture 29 [Lecture 28&29](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/statistics_110.md#lecture-28-) <br>
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« I think it can be marked as done <br>
### Lecture 4

### Lecture 5
2022/03/15:ðŸ’« 3136/011740 stuck at simple random walk exercise <br>
2022/03/15:ðŸ’« finished, understood the simple random walk exercise and done

### Lecture 6
2022/03/16:ðŸ’« finished, 20% blur + 30% clear + 10% blur + 30% blur + 10% clear <br>

### Lecture 7
2022/03/19:ðŸ’« 1842/012114 stationary, I don' have much sense about this word<br>
