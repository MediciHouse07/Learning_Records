### Lecture 1
2022/03/13: mumbling mumbling, but OK, 1930/010029 <br>

### Lecture 2
2022/03/17:ðŸ’« 2058/011236 stop at conjugate matrix, I don't what property it has <br>
2022/03/18:ðŸ’« 2538/011236 stop at SVD, from 20-25 is diagnolization matrix and its property  <br>
2022/03/18:ðŸ’« 2538/011236 this video can explain conjugate matrix, Hermitian matrices ?A=A^H=A^-^T? take conjugate then take transpose https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYS9EYZ3gCo
### Lecture 3
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« skip to tailor expectation things, stuck there, then went to check Lecture 9 in [Expectation 9 and 10 110](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/statistics_110.md#lecture-9-) <br>
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« Moment Generation Function, how to understand that easily? maybe need to check 110 as well Lecture 17 and Lecture 18 <br>
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« Moment Generation Function, get an idea of MGF Lecture 17 and Lecture 18, and the taylor something is just taylor series [Lecture 17&18](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/statistics_110.md#lecture-17-) <br>
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« Chef inequality, get an idea of inequality Lecture 28 and Lecture 29 [Lecture 28&29](https://github.com/MediciHouse07/Learning_Records/blob/main/statistics_110.md#lecture-28-) <br>
2022/03/14:ðŸ’« I think it can be marked as done <br>
### Lecture 4

### Lecture 5
2022/03/15:ðŸ’« 3136/011740 stuck at simple random walk exercise <br>
2022/03/15:ðŸ’« finished, understood the simple random walk exercise and done

### Lecture 6
2022/03/16:ðŸ’« finished, 20% blur + 30% clear + 10% blur + 30% blur + 10% clear <br>
2022/03/19:ðŸ’« review 3653-3658, need to check |DET| <br>
### Lecture 7
2022/03/19:ðŸ’« 1842/012114 stationary, I don' have much sense about this word<br>
2022/03/23:ðŸ’« finished roughly, monte carlo, why did he want to generate syn matrix? even they have the same property <br>
2022/03/23:ðŸ’« monte carlo video, randomness, sampling instead of all, simulation unbias https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ESK5SaP-bc
2022/04/03: 11900<->12212 looks good
2022/04/10: 0<->3321, till price yield curve;0000 mins, given what I experienced, this world can't offer a job I like;
0909 mins, oder statistics, a reason for you to review it; VAR 1% worst;
1300 mins, stationary;
1553 mins, take position, probably lose money, you defend equity;
1730 mins, frequency of changes;
1900 mins, Ki square distribution, is E(X-Xbar)^2 's distribution, you estimate paramebter, that var/n-1 is estimated parameter
### Lecture 8
2022/03/24:ðŸ’« 0514/11618, maximum likelihood estimation <br>
2022/03/28:ðŸ’« jump to 2700-2941, the first slides of time series lecture, p(x1,x2,x3...,xn) probabbility density function, hope it to be invary with translation of time
2022/04/03: 3450/11619 1052 mins, Q(beta) like a lost function; 1025 mins, ? + degree of freedom, consider n observations n parameters; 1338 mins MAD, the maximum result is undifferentiable; 1708 mins, case study 1
2022/04/05: 2730<->4721, 3100 mins, ACF, correlation coefficient is -1<=r<=1;
