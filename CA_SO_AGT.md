# 1 Strategic form games with complete information

## 1

2023/06/02

- strategy set, action set
- different at sequential game, strategy is more complicated
- expected utility

# 8 Voting

## 1

2023/06/14

- voting rule is a function F preference X is a subset of X

## 2

2023/06/14

- strategic vs truthfully reveal
- likelihood of tie
- tie breaking rule

## 3 

2023/06/15

- strategic interaction
- majority winner
- total rality is not majority

## 7

2023/06/15

- ordernal vs cardinal is lager than ordernal
- voting rule is correspondence maybe more than one value, not function one value return
- ballot

## 8

2023/06/15

- Pareto principle

## 9

2023/06/16

- anonymity
- permutation
- fix any permutation of electorate
- permute
- identity of the voters is not important

## 10

2023/06/16

- neutrality

## 11

2023/06/16

- independence of irrelevant alternatives
- use U to represent preference profile
- vote splitting
- condersen loser

## 12

2023/06/16

- ordinality
- utility for, utility of

## 13

2023/06/16

- decisiveness
- single valued function F

0000<->0100

- 1951 Arrow impossibility therom |X| at least 3 candidates, all preference profiles U
- no voting rule satisfying P(Pareto principle) A(anonymity) N(neutrality) IIA(drop candidates) D(decisive) O(ordernality)

# 11 Mechanism Design

## 4

2023/06/02

- preference depends only on his own type
- in this example
- ante
- private information, theta i
- voting
- cardinal vs ordinal
- decision could be d 1 d' 0
- anouncement of information theta

## 7

2023/06/01

- direct mechanism f
- mechanism induce games
- indirect mechanism vs direct mechanism
- ask them the truth state
- why using indirect mechanism

## 8

2023/06/01

- strategy proof, voting theory
- impossibility therom
