- common features of economic models
- the ceteris paribus assumption
- all other things being the same
- statistical method to apply economic research
- variables
- exogenous variables, external variables, determined ouside of the model

- model -> simplified version of real world -> assumptions
- ceteris paribus assumption, optimization assumption

- internal consistency
- so that math can be used
- relation to rationality
- maximizing a preference relation

- compare different bundles
- equivalent bundles on the same curve
- specicy a relation between 2 elements in X
- reflexivity
- equally happy, indifferent
- completeness = can't say I don't know, if the 2 are not equal, then there is completeness
- strictly perfer
- is preferred to
- ~this is equal

- x1 x2 xn are the quantities of n-goods that might be consumed
- all that matters is order
- bundle->element is quantity of goods
- and they are goods, not bads
- any more of xi and no less of the others is preferred to less of xi
