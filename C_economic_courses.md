## Lecture 6
2022/05/17:
finished
0200 mins, M is message or strategy space;

2022/05/18:
- mechanism
- message space;
- M is strategy space;
- g is outcome function
- g(M) = (gd(m),gt1(m),gt2(m)...) it should be a vector;
- g choose one social choice function;
- 0644 mins, good explaination, TBRT;
- 0913 mins, message space, it can be plant's type or U/D

## Lecture 8
2022/05/17:
0000<->0200

g(m(theta))=f(theta);

2022/05/17:
finished,
0000<->0200
0400 mins, strategy proof in voting theory;
0611 mins, direct mechanism means type space is strategy space;
0935 mins, contra-positive;
## Lecture 9

2022/05/17:
finished,
0209 mins, dictatorial;
0327 mins, a SCF only look at a specific voter;
0520 mins, SCF always select b, doesn't care about player's preference;

## Lecture 10

finished,
0339 mins, line up;
0500 mins, single peak;
0800 mins, this is a case study;

2022/05/18:
finished,
0000 mins, SCF, strategic proof;
0600 mins, median voting rule;
0654 mins, top alternative;

## Lecture 12
2022/05/18:
0000 mins, VCG mechanism;
0136 mins, t positive means receive;
0310 mins, quasi linear equation again;
1247 mins, marginal social impact, I guess the reason is this is just about one player;

## Lecture 13
2022/05/18:
finished,
0841 mins, auction theory is needed, voting theory is needed, TBR;
it seems second price auction can maximize the potential payment, payoffs ;

finished,
0050 mins, budget balance, TBRT, submission of transfer = 0;
0207 mins, efficient decision rule, efficient social choice rule;
0323 mins, individual rationality, utility has to be greater or equal to 0;
0443 mins, quasi linear again, TBR;

1321 mins, buyer get <0 utility by lying;
1353 mins, case study, a analysis to prove VCG;
2104 mins, utility of ling is lower or equal than telling the truth;
