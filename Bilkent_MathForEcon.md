- from 8 mins, it is where the course starts
- cloud are neccessary for rain
- but not sufficent
- euclidean space
- addition
- binary operation
- assotiativity
- multiplicative inverse
- order structure

- order structure, algebraic structure
- S at most one supremum, at most one infimum
- unique
- if unique, we can write SupS, it can be reffered as a real number
- max, min, supremum and infimum
- max, supremum of S and belongs to S
- S feasible bundles, there is supremum but no maximum
- another PROP
- yardstick
- y is arbitrarity close to the set
- epsilon example

- Supremum principle
- for empty set, because it has no element, false statement followed by anything can enable a true statement
- infimum principle
- practice the proof for 20 mins

- if it has upper bound, it has the least upper bound, supremium principle
- relatively prime, the only common divicer is 1
- proof of sqrt(2) is irrational number
- rational are everywhere in R, irrational are everywhere in R as well
- for any a,b belongs to R, there are infinite many rational and irrational

- point and set
- when is a point arbitrarily close to a given set
- property of real number system as given
- has a upper bound, will have a least upper bound
- least upper bound, greatest lower bound
- it has lower bound, but does it have greatest lower bound

- subspace of a vector space might not be a vector space
- restriction of addition and scalar multiplication
- R has a unique subspace which is 0
- R3 itself is a subspace of R3
- subspace doesn't need to satisfies to the definition of vector space

- no ambiguity in theta
- if x' is unique
- addictive inverse

- Set R'=R define Rn+1=Rn cross R
- Rn the set all ordered n tuple of real numbers
- Defn let x x1 xn y y1 yn belongs to Rn and c belongs to R
- Define plus and scalar mutiliplication
- binary operation from RR and cR to R
- SM1 means scalar multiplication
