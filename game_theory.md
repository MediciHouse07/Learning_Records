# Lecture 2
202/05/05: finished, 0700 mins, ingredient of a game;
2232 mins, strict dominated, handout
3000 mins, put yourself to other's shoes;
3241 mins, weakly dominated;
4000 mins, people are not random number generator;
5219 mins, iteration of in shoes;
5759 mins, common knowledge;
10840 mins, difference of mutual knowledge and common knowledge

# Lecture 3
2022/05/05: 0000<->3321, 0035 mins, iteration of deletion, and it will finally converge to 1;
0322 mins, political spectrum, from left to right, left is fruit eater, left is emgrt eater...;
0522 mins, key component of game theory, player, strategy, payoff...;
1300 mins, 2 strictly dominates 1 by 5%, the pattern is;
1733 mins, vote still there , strategy can be deleted;
2343 mins, median voter THM;
2600 mins, application of median voter THM is gas station, they will not evenly distributed on a road, they will tend to be closing to center.

2022/05/06: 3321<->the end, 3455 mins, some assumption can't be met, does it mean model doesn't work, should we abondone it? an argument
, you should enrich your model, instead of abondone it

3846 mins, political science model

4046 mins, different approach, best response, no dominated a scenario, but you manage to rationalize it

5042 mins, a diagram with p(r) on the x axis, E(payoff of choosing up) on the y axis, it is like a gamma, I guess this theory is more like the thing I have been searching.
haha, math phobe

10000 mins, the most important game in the world

# Lecture 4
2022/05/08:
0000<->3000
0114 mins, penalty kick in soccer game;
0530 mins, best, second best, worst;
1210 mins, middle is not hold in any believe;
1400 mins, don't choose a strategy that is never a best response to any belief;
2512 mins, BR best response, si hat, and si' is my strategy
2800 mins, expectation given the belief
EU1(L,P)=P(l)u1(L,l)+p(r)(L,r)
