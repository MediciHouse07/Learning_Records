# Lecture 2
202/05/05: finished, 0700 mins, ingredient of a game;
2232 mins, strict dominated, handout
3000 mins, put yourself to other's shoes;
3241 mins, weakly dominated;
4000 mins, people are not random number generator;
5219 mins, iteration of in shoes;
5759 mins, common knowledge;
10840 mins, difference of mutual knowledge and common knowledge

# Lecture 3
2022/05/05: 0000<->3321, 0035 mins, iteration of deletion, and it will finally converge to 1;
0322 mins, political spectrum, from left to right, left is fruit eater, left is emgrt eater...;
0522 mins, key component of game theory, player, strategy, payoff...;
1300 mins, 2 strictly dominates 1 by 5%, the pattern is;
1733 mins, vote still there , strategy can be deleted;
2343 mins, median voter THM;
2600 mins, application of median voter THM is gas station, they will not evenly distributed on a road, they will tend to be closing to center.

2022/05/06: 3321<->the end, 3455 mins, some assumption can't be met, does it mean model doesn't work, should we abondone it? an argument
, you should enrich your model, instead of abondone it

3846 mins, political science model

4046 mins, different approach, best response, no dominated a scenario, but you manage to rationalize it

5042 mins, a diagram with p(r) on the x axis, E(payoff of choosing up) on the y axis, it is like a gamma, I guess this theory is more like the thing I have been searching.
haha, math phobe

10000 mins, the most important game in the world

# Lecture 4
2022/05/08:
0000<->3000
0114 mins, penalty kick in soccer game;
0530 mins, best, second best, worst;
1210 mins, middle is not hold in any believe;
1400 mins, don't choose a strategy that is never a best response to any belief;
2512 mins, BR best response, si hat, and si' is my strategy
2800 mins, expectation given the belief
EU1(L,P)=P(l)u1(L,l)+p(r)(L,r)

2022/05/08:
3000<->End

3326 mins, continuous strategy;
3525 mins, bs1s2 implies the good part of work together;
3800 mins, continuous strategy;
4052 mins, handout, book need to download;
4324 mins, second derivative, to identify max and min;
4441 mins, BR1(s2), best response of player 1 given the response of player 2;
5040 mins, not to choose a strategy that is not best strategy of anything;
5807 mins, box will converge in the intersection;;
10029 mins, delete the are that are not best response to anyone;
10448 mins, externality, you put all your energy but you take half of the proft;
externality, my benefit not only benefit me, but also you
10800 mins, Nash Equilibrium;
10940 mins, on Nash Equilibrium, player 1 and player 2 neither of them have incentive to deviate their behaviour, and they are plaing a best response to each other;

# Lecture 5
2022/05/09:
0000<->3000
0048 mins, profile is a collection a strategy each player choose; One strategy for each players;
0147 mins, NE, each player's response should be best response in term's of other's choice, s-1; NE will not always happen;
0350 mins, no regret is a result of NE;
0730 mins, self-fulfilling;
1530 mins, analogous of NE between discrete case and continous case;
1637 mins, NE inter-section in discrete case;
1733 mins, rationality will make the result approach to the NE;
1800 mins, a circle, you know that I know things, TBRT; a case of rationality can't lead you to NE;
2337 mins, 1. dominance, 2. BR, 3.NE;
2659 mins, a strictly dominated can't be played in a NE;because it is not a BR to anything;
2813 mins, pay attention to weakly dominated strategy;
