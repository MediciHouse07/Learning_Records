1300 mins, 2 strictly dominates 1 by 5%, the pattern is;
1733 mins, vote still there , strategy can be deleted;
2343 mins, median voter THM;
2600 mins, application of median voter THM is gas station, they will not evenly distributed on a road, they will tend to be closing to center.

2022/05/06: 3321<->the end, 3455 mins, some assumption can't be met, does it mean model doesn't work, should we abondone it? an argument
, you should enrich your model, instead of abondone it

3846 mins, political science model

4046 mins, different approach, best response, no dominated a scenario, but you manage to rationalize it

5042 mins, a diagram with p(r) on the x axis, E(payoff of choosing up) on the y axis, it is like a gamma, I guess this theory is more like the thing I have been searching.
haha, math phobe

10940 mins, on Nash Equilibrium, player 1 and player 2 neither of them have incentive to deviate their behaviour, and they are plaing a best response to each other;

# Lecture 5
2022/05/09:
0000<->3000
0048 mins, profile is a collection a strategy each player choose; One strategy for each players;
0147 mins, NE, each player's response should be best response in term's of other's choice, s-1; NE will not always happen;
0350 mins, no regret is a result of NE;
0730 mins, self-fulfilling;
1530 mins, analogous of NE between discrete case and continous case;
1637 mins, NE inter-section in discrete case;
1733 mins, rationality will make the result approach to the NE;
1800 mins, a circle, you know that I know things, TBRT; a case of rationality can't lead you to NE;
2337 mins, 1. dominance, 2. BR, 3.NE;
2659 mins, a strictly dominated can't be played in a NE;because it is not a BR to anything;
2813 mins, pay attention to weakly dominated strategy;

2022/05/10:
3000<->10031, 9 minutes left;
3100 mins, if there is no strictly dominance, NE will generate some stupid conclusion;
4008 mins, 2 NE on the case, everyone invest or everyone doesn't invest;
4205 mins, think NE by thinking no regret;
4255 mins, guess and check is a good method, it is not a bad way to find NE; Especially for a lot of players, but the solution are not too much;
4619 mins, the play converge so fast towards to no invest; It is aproaching to not to invest NE, there are 2 NEs remember; parato dominated; bear market;
People are less of confident towards the market;
5041 mins, self-fulfilling proficy;
5136 mins, in prisoner's dillima, there is strictly dominated strategy, while in the investment game there is no strictly dominated strategy;
5320 mins, coordination game normally bad outcome is the result;
5939 mins, microsoft and network example will be like the investment game;

2022/05/11:
finished, 10000<->End,

10640 mins, after a speech, in this case, he is not trying to persuade you to play a dominated strategy, he persuade you to play a NE; contract is mentioned; NE can be self enforcing agreement;

# Lecture 6
2022/05/12:
0000<->4109
0000 mins, coordination game, investment game, coordination game can be changed by a speech;
0315 mins, I don't know why this game should be named as coordination game;
0440 mins, games of strategic complemente;
0517 mins, "Going to the movies" game; each perfers a different NE, there is conflict of interest in this game;
1839 mins, battle of the sexes;
1904 mins, corner nomopoly; cournot duopoly model, 2 monopoly, recommend book; 2 extream examples, monopoly, and perfect competition;

players: 2 firms, produce the same things;
strategies, quantity they produced, qi q-i;
cost of production, cq, constant marginal cost;
prices;
payoff, profit is denoted as profit, u(q1,q2)=pq1-cq1; and it can be re-writed by putting P in u;
2900 mins, how to find NE in this case, find BR of the 2 players and find intersection;cournot duopoly;
first order condition q1; then check second order condition with respect to q1, concave make you have a best, maximum profit; BR1(q2), player 1 best response for the possible choice of player 2;
3827 mins, player 2 produce nothing, player 1 is monopoly;
4027 mins, marginal revenue =  marginal cost;

2022/05/12:
4109<->4407 
3907 mins, why monopoly quantity = where MC=MR;
OK, in the Khan video of monopoly topic, it says this;
a-c/2b can be viewd from both methods;
4407 mins, TBRT, I didn't get why the way of making player 1 to produce nothing is to let player 2 to produce a-c/b instead of a-c/2b

2022/05/12:
4407 mins, I think I got it now, write the BR function directly, in order to make q1 produce nothing, BR2(q1): a-c-bq2/2b=q1, set q1=0, we get q2=a-c/b

2022/05/13:
finished,
4407<->End
Basing on BR1, if q2 produce nothing, BR1 is a-c/2b, while if q2 produce a-c/2b then player 1 will produce nothing, BR1=0
4440 mins, demand curve intersect with marginal cost curve, makes other player shut down, even itself; competitive quantity, perfect competition quantity, compare it with monopoly quantity;
BR1 is a linear function of q2;
5200 mins, connour quantity;
5400 mins, this game is opposite with partnership game, and investment game, straetgic substitutes;
total industry profit, monopoly maximize total industry profit; use legal to regulate oligopoly companies;
10400 mins, incentive to cheat; county's will is GDP, total industry profit, but that is not the interest of companies;
10708 mins, when new entrances join the industry, the old big company will cheat becasue they signed an agreement;
totald quantity, NE, monopoly quantity, competitive quantity; quantity is on the one direction, price is on the another direction;
