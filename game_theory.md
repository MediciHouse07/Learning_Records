In mainstream economics, economic surplus, also known as total welfare or Marshallian surplus, refers to two related quantities. Consumer surplus or consumers' surplus is the monetary gain obtained by consumers because they are able to purchase a product for a price that is less than the highest price that they would be willing to pay. Producer surplus or producers' surplus is the amount that producers benefit by selling at a market price that is higher than the least that they would be willing to sell for. In Marxian economics, the term surplus may also refer to surplus value, surplus product and surplus labour.;

Complete information and incomplete information
Simultaneously, when both side knows each others gain, that is a complete information game, otherwise it is a imperfect information

Perfect information and imperfect information
Sequentially, when the defensive knows what the offensive choose, that is a perfect information, otherwise it is imperfect information
Need to double check the idea of involve the nature thing and information set the fog

Bayesian NE, the NE in the incomplete information game, a way to handle it is to turn an incomplete information game to an imperfect information game
