39 Lectures TTL
### Lecture 1 <br>
2022/3/12: learned Lecture 1 <br>
### Lecture 2 <br>
2022/3/12:learned Lecture 2 quit at 30:55 <br>
Hope that I would note dive too deep into math learning things<br>
Lecture 2 is finished, continuous stuff
* f is differentiable, in other word, derivitave exists <br>
### Lecture 3 <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 3 01:36 , (cu)'=cu' <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 3 0753/4954 (sinx)' <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 3 1125/4954 (cosx)' <br>
2022/03/13: Lecture 3 2119/4954 sin 0 ' and cos 0 ' at x=0 gives value of all sinx' and cosx', why? <br>
- 2022/03/14: No answer to this yet, sorry <br>

2022/03/14: Lecture 3 done, it is really interesting to know that proof can be done in geometric way <br>
### Lecture 4 <br>
2022/03/14: 1808/4602 derevative of product, derevative of quotient <br>
2022/03/14: finished <br>
### Lecture 5 <br>
2022/03/15: finished, inverse function, d/dx as an operator, implicilty calculate the derivative, all 3 combines make the life easier <br>
### Lecture 6 <br>
2022/03/16: finished, a^x' loga(x)' really a fun process when seeing these formula are deprived 👍
### Lecture 7 <br>
2022/03/15: 0809/5052, review class, lecturer is trying to re-calculate the derivative in several different ways <br>
2022/03/15: 2423/5052, chain rule, intuitively sense it, it is the a speed-up effect on y with dx * dt <br>
2022/03/25: finished, there is no lecture 8 <br>

### Lecture 14 <br>
2022/03/29: 💫finished, the begining of the lecture has something to do with Newton's law, it is just like an iteration of linear approximation
### Lecture 15 <br>
2022/03/28:💫 finished, mean value therom to be watched
### Lecture 16 <br>
2022/03/13:💫 Lecture 16 0638/4524, followed, but need further explaination <br>
2022/03/23:💫 finished done, need to check anti derivative, go to previous lecture, maybe Lecture 15

### Lecture 23 <br>
2022/03/26:💫 0444/4835, curious of the title of the course, pre content might be reman sum
### Lecture 37 <br>
2022/03/25:💫 1827/5011, jump to this course out of curious, pre-lecture: anti-derivative, partial fraction intergral, improper intergral <br>
2022/03/26: finished, the rest part is not that hard<br>

### Lecture 38 <br>
2022/03/26:  finished, decimal expansion, what is that? they say it has something to do with rational numbers, maybe it is two Z, one devided by another so that a rational can be expressed <br>
