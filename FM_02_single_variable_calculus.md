2022/05/10: 
finished
0410 mins, error analysis;
0821 mins, newton's method works if f' is not too small, f'' is not to big, x0 start nearby;
parabola;
1337 mins, f'(x0) = 0, x1 is unreachable, so that means x1 is undefined;
1624 mins, MVT;
1941 mins, MVT condition, continuous at a<=x<=b, differentiable a<x<b; difference between differentiable and continous, TBR;
continous, limx->0=0, contious, f';
2530 mins, the case where hypothesis doesn't meet;
2753 mins, applications;
knowing who is treating you good is hard;
2957 mins, re-write derivative formula and MVT and notice the link between the two, MVT make derivative exist?;
3747 mins, minf'<=MVT=f'<=maxf' ;corollary, neccessary ;
4003 mins, linear approximation says average speed equals initial spe ed, MVT says averge speed equals the speed at point c;
4414 mins, the only thing about MVT you need to know;
minf'<=MVT=f'<=maxf';
4443 mins, inequalities; e^x>1+x , e^x>1+x+x^2/2, and so on, taylor series again;
### Lecture 15 <br>
2022/03/28:üí´ finished, mean value therom to be watched
### Lecture 16 <br>
2022/03/13:üí´ Lecture 16 0638/4524, followed, but need further explaination <br>
2022/03/23:üí´ finished done, need to check anti derivative, go to previous lecture, maybe Lecture 15

anti derivative is not about a or b;
0605 mins, he says in the last lecture, they handle intergral 0 to b is laborious, so TBR the last lecture to see what method he was using, maybe is reman sum;
1225 mins, odometer, speedometer;
1429 mins, sum is approximation of intergral;
Riemann sum;
2200 mins, total distance can be calculated with a absolute operation;
2306 mins, integral of sum = sumof integral, integral sign is a sum, in French it is called as sum;
other properties of integral; c can be factoring out if it doesn't depend on x;
3313 mins, inequality, keep integral it repeatedly, then you get taylor series sort of;
3731 mins, change of variable for substitution; u' doesn't change sign;
4152 mins, the reason for using dx or du;
### Lecture 20
2022/05/21:
0000<->1717

0000 mins;

- FTC1, intergral from a to b = F(a) - F(b);

1500 mins;

### Lecture 23 <br>

### Lecture 29
2022/05/14:
0000<->1857, next, an example of repeated roots and repeated factors
0050 mins, P(x)/Q(x), ratio of two polynomials, rational function; whole power is good for this example, square root is not good;
1300 mins, 1. factor Q, 2. setup, 2. coverup;
1530 mins, a good example of cover up;
1700 mins, the condition for cover up works;

finished, 
1857<->End
2100 mins, how to deal with power;
4456 mins, improper fraction;

### Lecture 30
2022/05/17:
0000<->1612
0110 mins, partial fractions;
1249 mins, he used substitution here, TBR substitution;

2022/05/18:
finished,
1612<->End
1641 mins, complete the square technique;
1838 mins, integration by parts;
2000 mins, integration by parts is derived from product rule;

### Lecture 37 <br>
2022/03/25:üí´ 1827/5011, jump to this course out of curious, pre-lecture: anti-derivative, partial fraction intergral, improper intergral <br>
2022/03/26: finished, the rest part is not that hard<br>

### Lecture 38 <br>
2022/03/26:  finished, decimal expansion, what is that? they say it has something to do with rational numbers, maybe it is two Z, one devided by another so that a rational can be expressed <br>
