- c is cost
- x is pay per unit
- y is reim bursement for the parts exceed z
- i is number of failures
- prepared a model that can be utilized in tool

- loss suffered by B is a decreasing function of time
- disutility
- don't consider reimbursement at the beginning
- exponential distribution
- failure times
- failure before latin word
- downward curve, PDF
- ft is a PDF
- loss in terms of money times the probability of the loss

- revisit the buyer's model
- seems buyer's expectated reimbursement is the same as seller's liability

- piB(p) B's personal probability for the unknown p

- End

- don't get the formula, it should be w>2x
- but by intuition it is w>x because if there is no failure product, then there is no reimbursement and loss

- hatch
- apply L'p rule, shows that it is nx not 2nx, question, does L'p rule still work if it is to infinity
- translate the seller's gain graph and buyer's gain graph to x y hatch region
