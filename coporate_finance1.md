1046<->1339, IR increase, price of bond decrease; YTM down, price up;
1358 mins, price of bond = PVIFA + PVIF

2022/04/03: ðŸ’« 0134 mins, RoR need to check, rate of return , Expected return = r = (DIV1+P1-P0)/P0; 0717 mins, return risk = unsystematic + systematic; 1100 mins, a nice pic, about market risk and unsystematic risk; 
3127 mins, portfolio beta = weighted individual stock beta;
unique risk
2700 mins, beta = % delta ri/ % delta rm, where ri is some specific stock, or portfolio; expected return = r = (DIV1 + P1 + P0)/P0;
2755 mins, aggressive stock, defensive stock, threshold = 1;
1439 mins, risk free return, treasure bill + risk premium;
1946 misn beta formula;

fully diversified portfolio is sitting right on the security market line;
security market line is equvalant with E(r) = rf + beta i (rm - rf), which is a straight line which has intercepor risk free rate, and when x axis = 1 the y axis equals market rate;
risk premium = beta i (rm - rf);
market risk premium = rm - rf;
255 mins, beta i = % delta risk i / % delta risk m;
1704 mins, if beta = 0.25, 0.25 = 0*wf + 1*wm = 0(1-wm) + wm -> wm=0.25, wf=0.75;
1800 E(rp) = wrf * rf + wm * rm;
