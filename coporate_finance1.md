1046<->1339, IR increase, price of bond decrease; YTM down, price up;<br>
1358 mins, price of bond = PVIFA + PVIF<br>

2022/04/03: ðŸ’« 0134 mins, RoR need to check, rate of return , Expected return = r = (DIV1+P1-P0)/P0; <br>
0717 mins, return risk = unsystematic + systematic; <br>
1100 mins, a nice pic, about market risk and unsystematic risk; <br>
3127 mins, portfolio beta = weighted individual stock beta;<br>
unique risk<br>
2700 mins, beta = % delta ri/ % delta rm, where ri is some specific stock, or portfolio; expected return = r = (DIV1 + P1 + P0)/P0;<br>
2755 mins, aggressive stock, defensive stock, threshold = 1;<br>
1439 mins, risk free return, treasure bill + risk premium;<br>
1946 misn beta formula;<br>

fully diversified portfolio is sitting right on the security market line;<br>
security market line is equvalant with E(r) = rf + beta i (rm - rf), which is a straight line which has intercepor risk free rate, and when x axis = 1 the y axis equals market rate;<br>
risk premium = beta i (rm - rf);<br>
market risk premium = rm - rf;<br>
255 mins, beta i = % delta risk i / % delta risk m;<br>
1704 mins, if beta = 0.25, 0.25 = 0*wf + 1*wm = 0(1-wm) + wm -> wm=0.25, wf=0.75;<br>
1800 E(rp) = wrf * rf + wm * rm;<br>
