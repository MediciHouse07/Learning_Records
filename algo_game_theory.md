this course is more close to computer science, I can still learn it when I tend to like computer science, sometimes I do like that. And, because I will feel excited when I learn econ wise of game theory or incentive theory, so I guess I will put myself close to that direction, hope that I can find a balance between the two.

- one slot, is single item auction
- goods are not the same, goods here are slots
- above 2 makes it different with single item auction, if it is a single item auction, you can use second price auction
- alpha, probability of clicking the j's slot
- CTR
- vi time alpha j, unless alpha is 100% otherwise it can't reflect advertizer's valuation, because they care about click
- which advertizr to pick, which order they should be on, what price they should pay
- DSIC auction
- xi is the CTR of the slot i get assigned
- subject to feasibility, one advertizer per slot
- 10300 mins question about one bidder get more than one slot
- he will continue to talk this topic in the next lecture
- decide who wins, decide the winner to pay
- it has to be a joint activity
- 11100 mins answer to step 1

- collusion
- 4743 sponsor search auction
- sponsor links, organic search results
- bid on keyword
- single item auction
- slots are the sponsor list
- click through rate

3000<->4500

- only two things are possible
- vi and B, vi-B
- second price auction is no regret
- every honest bidder gets non negtative utility
- 1.dominant strategy, incentive compatible DSIC, claim 1 + claim 2
- 2. Vickrey auction is awesome, social surplus = SIGMA vixi

0000<->1500

- give the person who evaluate the price of it the most, and that end up with people just write the highest number
- name birthday, evaluation = mm + dd) times .10, mine is 2 D, the most is 4.3 USD
- no need to pay the price you evaluate can be a useful method of weighing people for a job

1500<->3000

- that is evaluation, not price, OK price is also a depends thing
- what if the 1 1 people bid it then sell it to a 12 31 people, this would end up with better off for two person
- no need to pay is definitely equal to people running for a job
- ebay is not first price auction
- ebay pay the second highest bid
- sealed bid auction
- designer to predict what would happen
- second bid auction would result in vi=bi, each bidders true price is revealed, that is also a dominant strategy
- b_minus i
- is utility is maximized by bidding vi
- B = max bj j<>i

2022/08/05

0000<->1500

- single item auctions
- sealed bid auction
- not to discourage the incentive to overbidding
- sealed bid, first price auction

- 3 orthognal property are satisfied in vbk rule
- vi is value per unit of goods
- one parameter means only vi is unknown
- pick who wins is allocation rule, pay how much is payment rule
- utility = vi times xi(b) minus pi(b)
