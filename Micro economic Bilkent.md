- max, subject to some constraint
- firm maximize profit
- consumer maximize utility
- benovelent public welfare
- write a question into a model, and solve it
- economic behaviour agent, consumer, firm
- upward demand curve, gifin good
- rational agents
- duality between tehir aims
- partial equalibrium
- one market analysis is partial equlibrium
- a general market is general equlibrium
- perfect competition
- ECON 204
- economic models
- simplified representation of the target of the study
- simplification=assumption
- quota, quantity limited by some entity
- assume firm are identical
- hypothesis + test

- common features of economic models
- the ceteris paribus assumption
- all other things being the same
- statistical method to apply economic research
- variables
- exogenous variables, external variables, determined ouside of the model
- endogenous variables, internal variables, can be controlled
- pool player
- though thy don't know optimization, but they behave as optimization thoery said

- how to check the validity of our models
- direct approach
- implications
- go ahead and test implications, indirect approach
- test assumption vs test implication
- LR is about maximize profit
- ignores gaining reputation, obtaining power, prestige
- principle agent problem
- fly business class
- fly economic class
- milton feyman
- if p then q 1500 mins
- take these implication to data to check
- empirical analysis vs theory
- applied micro economist

0000<->1500

- model -> simplified version of real world -> assumptions
- ceteris paribus assumption, optimization assumption
- dual problem, maximize utility <-> minimaze utility, kind of identical problem
- suppose a firm can sell all the output it wishes to sell at price p per unit
- PI=TR-TC
- concave is a hill, and reverse is convex
- profit max, where MC is increasing
- 2 points one is to maximize lost another is to minimize lost
- q star is a function of p
- testable implication
