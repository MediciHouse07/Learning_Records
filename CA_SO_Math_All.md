# I_Logic
## Logic 1

2023/05/01

- basic atomac sentences
- reasoning
- declarative sentences, true or false
- P equavalent to
- P->Q can't be true and false

2023/04/07

- basic atomic sentences
- logical language
- declarative sentences
- declarative sentences
- P is sufficient condition for Q
- Q is a necessary condition for P
- negation

## Logic 2

2023/05/05

0000<->0500

- argument, ordered list sentences
- premises, proposition
- valid arguments with false premises and false conclusion
- Miami is not is not the capital of Kansas, Miami is not in Canada
- argument doesn't have to be true, it should be valid
- sentence can't be valid, it can only be either true or false
- TBRT review premises defn, true argument x and valid sentence x

2023/05/01

- argument order list of sentences, conclusion, premises
- validity
- a sentence
- argument doesn't have to be true, a sentence doesn't have to be true
- sound argument: valid argument with true premises
- valid argument: one where if premises are true then conclusion is also true
- truth table
- P->Q, only TF is false

## Logic 3

2023/05/07

- atomic sentence
- -> => equivalent
- both premises are true, valid argument
- premise and conclusion
- if sometimes premises are true but conclusion are falise, it is an invald argument

## Logic 4

2023/05/07

- valid argument or not
- all premises are true, conclusion must be true
- when not are premises are true, that row we don't care

## 5

2023/05/08

- PQ and QP is it valid
- all premises are true, the conclusion must be true

## 6

2023/05/08

- PQ and not Q not P

## 7

2023/05/08

- proving an argument = valid argument
- inference rules
- modus ponens modus tollens double negation
- if XX is true

# IV_Real_Analysis

## Real_Analysis 1

2023/05/04

- measure distance of a set
- when talking about distance, don't consider distance
- d X cross X over R
- non negativeness
- identification
- symmetry
- triangular inequality
- port won't make the distance shorter
- combination of X and d are metric space
- |.|

## Real_Analysis 2

- compact set
- compactness
- there exists
- no bound, you can always find a bigger number
- r-neighborhood of x
- mother set
- three line is define
- open neighborhoold

## Real_Analysis 3

- accumulation point
- limit point
- when r is very small
- can't isolate
- some point can be isolated from a set, some can't

## Real_Analysis 4

- closed and compact sets
- 0 and 1 are also accumulation set of the open set
- mother space
- natural number include all of its accumulation points
- closeness, boundness, logically independent
- bounded but not closed, and closed but not bounded
- closed and bounded is compact set
- all the definition is iff
- searching maximum iff you know there exist maximum
- the next course is optimization

# V_Optimization

## Optimization 1

2023/05/04

0000<->0500

- calculate the derivative through definition
