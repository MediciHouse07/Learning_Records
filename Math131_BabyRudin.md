- define truth relation by different sign
- it is related with both set and the sign
- how the sign is defined
- < an order on S
- put an order on complex number
- boundedness
- upper bound, bounded above
- supremum, infimum
- for real number, whenever you have an upper bound, you will be guranteed to have a least upper bound

- ordered field, sub field, least upper bound property
- binary truth relation <
- ordered sets
- (S,<) is called an ordered set
- lexicographical order is the order for complex number
- that means it depends on how you define the order (S,<)

- infinitely many sets cartesian with each other
- to me the way of constructing the sequence b or s sounds like a magic, we know sometimes it is not allowed to make a statement that strong
- infinite sequences, that's what we are discussing
- cartesian vector, they are all of the same length
- X,d metric space
- d metric
