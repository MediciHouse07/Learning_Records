- open cover
- choose one sub cover that cover the set
- you don't need t have infinite sets to cover a set
- finite implies compact
- compact is generalized concept of finiteness
- every cover has to have a finite cover, R
- no matter what cover we have, we can find finite sub cover
- find an open power that have finite 
- (0,1) not compact, [0,1] compact

- relative openness
- open relative to R not to R2
- because can't find a neighborhood of E within in E
- E doesn't contain all of its interior point

- because it is the smallest one
- E closure is the smallest closed set containing E

- reduce it to its previous state
