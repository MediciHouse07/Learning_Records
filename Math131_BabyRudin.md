- define truth relation by different sign
- it is related with both set and the sign
- how the sign is defined
- < an order on S
- put an order on complex number
- boundedness
- upper bound, bounded above
- supremum, infimum
- for real number, whenever you have an upper bound, you will be guranteed to have a least upper bound

3000<->4500

- ordered field, sub field, least upper bound property
- binary truth relation <
- ordered sets
- (S,<) is called an ordered set
- lexicographical order is the order for complex number
- that means it depends on how you define the order (S,<)

1500<->3000

- it could not have been in xx
- algebrac analytic
- analytic completeness

0000<->1500

2023/09/28

- rational number, Q quotient
- algebric completeness
- analytical completeness

- example is 2 times 2 return 0, that means there is 0 divisor
- R property, archimedian property

2023/10/05

4500<->6000

- C is not an ordered field
- 0 divisor
- R contain Q as sub field, has LUB property

2023/10/04

3000<->4500

- matrix is not a field
