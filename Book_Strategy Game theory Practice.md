- Grim trigger is a strategy used in game theory to enforce cooperation in repeated games. In this strategy, a player begins by cooperating with another player, and continues to cooperate as long as the other player also cooperates. However, if the other player defects (i.e., does not cooperate), the player using the grim trigger strategy responds by defecting in all subsequent rounds of the game. Essentially, the grim trigger strategy involves punishing a defection by permanently switching from cooperation to defection. This can help to deter other players from defecting in the first place, as they know they will face a permanent defection from the other player if they do not cooperate.
